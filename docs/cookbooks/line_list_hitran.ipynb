    "# HITRAN/HITEMP line-list tutorial\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to fetch HITRAN/HITEMP line lists, and sample them into cross-section files for use in ``Pyrat Bay`` radiative-transfer calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "``Pyrat Bay`` has a two-step process to process line lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert line lists** from their original format (e.g., HITRAN ``.par`` files, ExoMol ``.states/.trans`` files) **into transition-line information files (TLI files)**.  This is simple a re-formatting step, the data is still kept as the info per line-transition (wavelengths, *gf*, *Elow*, isotope).  TLI files can readily be used for ``Pyrat Bay`` radiative-transfer calculations, but such runs are slow as the code computes the lines shape and strength *on the fly* to obtain the cross sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conver TLI files into cross-section tables** (saved as Numpy ``.npz`` files).  This step evaluates (i.e., *samples*) the line-transition information over a grid of [wavelength, temperature, pressure], which involves computing the line shape and strength of all lines at each given wl, pressure, and temperature value of the grid.   Cross-section tables are ideal for radiative-transfer calculations, since the code simply interpolates from them (and therefore, these calculations are fast).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue with cross-section is that they are not too flexible (one might want to change, e.g., the wavelength resolution or line broadening parameters, for which the user would need to re-generate cross-sections from the TLI files).  For this reason ``Pyrat Bay`` was designed with this two-step approach."

    "## Compute TLI files\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to generate TLI files is via configuration files and the command line.  The config file below ([tli_hitran_H2O_cookbook.cfg](https://github.com/pcubillos/pyratbay/blob/master/docs/cookbooks/tli_hitran_H2O_cookbook.cfg)) converts the HITRAN/H2O line-list (see ``dblist``) into a TLI file (see ``tlifile`` or ``logfile``).\n",
    "\n",
    "Partition-function information must also be provided (see ``pflist``).  If you set ``pflist=tips``, ``Pyrat Bay`` will use the partition functions from [Gamache et al. (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017JQSRT.203...70G).  Alternatively, one can input the path to a partition-function file [TBD: Explain how].\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the user can specify the wavelength range of the extracted data (see ``wllow`` and ``wlhigh``).  Normally one set the widest know range (to avoid needing to re-calculating TLI files if a future calculation needs it), but for sake of this demo, we will extract just over the region that we need:\n",
