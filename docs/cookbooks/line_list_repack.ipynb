    "# Repack line lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, computing cross-section spectra from billions of line transitions becomes unfeasible. For such cases, the `repack` tool [(Cubillos 2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...850...32C) helps to identify and retain the strong line transitions that dominate the spectrum.  `repack` effectively the line list down to millions, without significantly impacting the cross section spectra. This tutorial shows how to fetch line lists that have been pre-processed with `repack`, and sample them into cross-section files for use in ``Pyrat Bay`` radiative-transfer calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "``Pyrat Bay`` has a two-step process to process line lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert line lists** from their original format (e.g., HITRAN ``.par`` files, ExoMol ``.states/.trans`` files) **into transition-line information files (TLI files)**.  This is simple a re-formatting step, the data is still kept as the info per line-transition (wavelengths, *gf*, *Elow*, isotope).  TLI files can readily be used for ``Pyrat Bay`` radiative-transfer calculations, but such runs are slow as the code computes the lines shape and strength *on the fly* to obtain the cross sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conver TLI files into cross-section tables** (saved as Numpy ``.npz`` files).  This step evaluates (i.e., *samples*) the line-transition information over a grid of [wavelength, temperature, pressure], which involves computing the line shape and strength of all lines at each given wl, pressure, and temperature value of the grid.   Cross-section tables are ideal for radiative-transfer calculations, since the code simply interpolates from them (and therefore, these calculations are fast).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue with cross-section is that they are not too flexible (one might want to change, e.g., the wavelength resolution or line broadening parameters, for which the user would need to re-generate cross-sections from the TLI files).  For this reason ``Pyrat Bay`` was designed with this two-step approach."
